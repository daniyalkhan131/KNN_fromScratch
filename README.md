# KNN_fromScratch
K-nearest neighbour implemented in python without using any library. Inputs are generated randomly. This is implemented so can understand the concept easily and if any modification or problem you see then please let me know.


both .ipynb and .py have same logic, code may be different but for beginner's understanding, they can easily get concept from .ipynb file
